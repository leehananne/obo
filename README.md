### About
**FOR**: Project-ID - A Better Singapore Challenge (October 2021 Semester)

Project-ID is a module under Ngee Ann Polytechnic's School of Interdisciplinary Studies. This module seeks to tackle problems such as the economic impacts of COVID-19, access to basic needs & resources,  an ageing society and increasing amounts of waste through an integration of knowledge and skills of different disciplines.

Therefore, each team of students are of different disciplines - my team comprises of 2 students studying Engineering Science (including myself), 2 students studying Early Childhood Development and Education and 1 student studying Film Sound and Video.

### The Project
PROJECT OBO is our solution to solving our driving question of 

> How can we develop alternative agriculutral techniques that could circumvent Singapore's limited land use, in order to grow our food supply?

We decided to tackle this as the amount of vegetables Singapore currently produces locally is less than 5 percent of what we consume, with most of our food being imported. This highlights a lack of food security which has been further exacerbated by Singapore's problem of land scarcity and potential unexpected cuts of supply routes, such as those that happened during COVID-19.

You can view our showcase [here](https://sites.google.com/np.edu.sg/proidclasssitet01/project-obo?authuser=0).

### The Website
The interactive website includes 3D models of our prototype, resources that our stakeholders may need, as well as information regarding the functionality of our proposed designs to address potential concerns that were highlighted during our validating process.
