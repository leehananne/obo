# Virtual Exhibition Website for Project OBO
_**FOR**: Project-ID - A Better Singapore Challenge (October 2021 Semester)_


### About The Project
This is part of our solution to solving our driving question of **how can we develop alternative agriculutral techniques that could circumvent Singapore's limited land use** in order to grow our food supply?

We decided to tackle this as the vegetables Singapore currently produces locally is less than 5 percent of what we consume, and most of our food is imported - therefore highlighting a lack of food security. This has been further exacerbated by Singapore's problem of land scarcity and potential unexpected cuts of supply routes, such as those that happened during COVID-19.

### The Website
The interactive website includes 3D models of our prototype, resources that our stakeholders may need, as well as information regarding the functionality of our proposed designs to address potential concerns that were highlighted during our validating process.
